# AudioDude
Make your computer speak!

# Switch language
To switch from english to french, go to: 
Options > Switch language

The UI will be translated and the "Surprime me!" button will read messages in the correct language.  

# Zero modularity
Sorry for making the whole app one massive file with absolutely no modularity. This is one of my first projects, I'm still learning the basics. 

# Executable
I used pyinstaller to turn the "main.py" file into the "AudioDude.exe" executable file. It can be used without the Python interpreter by anyone with Windows!
